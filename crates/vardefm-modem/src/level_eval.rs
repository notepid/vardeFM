//! Decoding performance per mode and speed level, against a recorded baseline.
//!
//! Two error rates through the FM channel simulator, both from the known burst
//! position, so detection is left out (the detector evaluation, `detect_eval`,
//! covers it):
//! - per level, the codeword error rate (CER), with the sent header as channel
//!   training, as `Receiver::step` decodes the payload once the header has decoded;
//! - per mode and drive, the header error rate (HER): the header decoded from
//!   preamble B alone, as `Receiver::step` does first. The header is coded and
//!   modulated the same at every level, but `Modem::modulate` scales the whole
//!   burst to its level's drive (`Modem::tx_rms`), so the header of a high level
//!   goes out quieter. One point per mode and drive covers it, measured on
//!   one-codeword bursts of the lowest level sent at that drive.
//!
//! Why one point per drive should suffice: every symbol of a burst carries the same
//! mean power before scaling, so the header's level depends on the drive and hardly
//! on the burst's length or payload. Clipping, heavy at wide mode's 0.5 drive, does
//! depend on the header codeword: with one fixed header the useful level at that
//! drive varied by 0.3 dB between levels and codeword counts. So each trial draws
//! the header fields that change from burst to burst at random (`trial_header`);
//! for a level's codewords, that header is also the channel training.
//! `header_level_depends_only_on_drive` checks the claim as an estimate, not as a
//! measured HER: on the noiseless transmitted header, averaged over those draws, the
//! useful level less the clipping distortion (counted as noise at
//! `HEADER_REFERENCE_SNR_DB`) agrees within `HEADER_LEVEL_TOLERANCE_DB` at every
//! drive.
//!
//! A burst decodes only if both its header and its codewords do. At level 0's drive
//! the header's point lies above level 0's, so there the header limits a burst, and
//! its curve is far shallower than any level's: at level 1's point a few per cent of
//! headers still fail.
//!
//! The codewords decode as `Receiver::step` decodes them, with the later passes of
//! `Modem::decode_payload_passes` at 16QAM and 64QAM (issue #2). Points recorded
//! before them (eb35213 and earlier) are single-pass; recording again may move levels
//! 3 to 6 down. That has not been measured: the gate's bursts hold only `CODEWORDS`
//! codewords, so a failed one shares points with fewer decoded ones than in a full
//! burst, and the shift may stay within the margin.
//!
//! What the gate does not cover:
//! - The receiver's SNR estimate, which the link's rate thresholds
//!   (`SNR_THRESHOLDS_DB`) are compared against. `level_table` reports it.
//! - Long bursts and clock drift: bursts hold up to `CODEWORDS` codewords and the
//!   channel presets have no clock offset, so pilot tracking over a long burst is
//!   not exercised.
//! - Error floors: the gate checks only where a rate crosses 10 %, so a change that
//!   loses a few per cent of codewords at every CNR (LLR saturation, a demapper
//!   edge case, a sync slip) still passes.
//! - `Receiver` itself: the gate repeats its decoding steps (header from preamble
//!   B, then the codewords with the header as training) rather than calling it, so
//!   a change to how `Receiver::step` trains or decodes moves no point.
//!
//! `perf/levels.toml` holds, per mode and drive, the CNR at which the HER crosses
//! 10 % and, per mode and level, the CNR at which the CER does. `level_gate` fails
//! when a point has moved by more than its margin (`GATE_MARGIN_DB`, `HEADER_MARGIN_DB` for the
//! shallower header curve): the rate must be below 10 % that far above the point and
//! above 10 % that far below. Each point decodes `GATE_BURSTS` bursts
//! of up to `CODEWORDS` codewords, or `HEADERS_PER_BURST` times as many headers.
//! Results do not depend on the number of threads. They may differ in the last bits
//! between platforms whose maths libraries round `ln`, `cos` or `powf` differently,
//! which moves points near the margin.
//!
//! `cargo test --release -p vardefm-modem level_gate -- --ignored --nocapture`
//!
//! `level_sweep` measures the points again; with `WRITE=1` it records them, and the
//! commit and command, in `perf/levels.toml`. Commit the code first, so the recorded
//! commit is the one measured.
//!
//! `WRITE=1 cargo test --release -p vardefm-modem level_sweep -- --ignored --nocapture`
//!
//! Environment: `MODES` (narrow,wide), `LEVELS` (0,1,..,6; `h` is the header at
//! every drive), `TRIALS` (bursts per point: 100 for the gate, 200 for the sweep's
//! fine grid), `WRITE` (sweep only).
