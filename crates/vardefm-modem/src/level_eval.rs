//! Decoding performance per mode and speed level, against a recorded baseline.
//!
//! Two error rates through the FM channel simulator, both from the known burst
//! position, so detection is left out (the detector evaluation, `detect_eval`,
//! covers it):
//! - per level, the codeword error rate (CER), with the sent header as channel
//!   training, as `Receiver::step` decodes the payload once the header has decoded;
//! - per mode, the header error rate (HER): the header decoded from preamble B
//!   alone, as `Receiver::step` does first. The header is coded and modulated the
//!   same at every level, so one point per mode covers it.
//!
//! A burst decodes only if both its header and its codewords do. The header's point
//! lies above level 0's, so there the header limits a burst, and its curve is far
//! shallower than any level's: at level 1's point a few per cent of headers still
//! fail.
//!
//! What the gate does not cover:
//! - The receiver's SNR estimate, which the link's rate thresholds
//!   (`SNR_THRESHOLDS_DB`) are compared against. `level_table` reports it.
//! - Long bursts and clock drift: bursts hold up to `CODEWORDS` codewords and the
//!   channel presets have no clock offset, so pilot tracking over a long burst is
//!   not exercised.
//!
//! `perf/levels.toml` holds, per mode, the CNR at which the HER crosses 10 % and, per
//! mode and level, the CNR at which the CER does. `level_gate` fails when a point has
//! moved by more than its margin (`GATE_MARGIN_DB`, `HEADER_MARGIN_DB` for the
//! shallower header curve): the rate must be below 10 % that far above the point and
//! above 10 % that far below. Each point decodes `GATE_BURSTS` bursts
//! of up to `CODEWORDS` codewords, or `HEADERS_PER_BURST` times as many headers.
//! Results do not depend on the number of threads. They may differ in the last bits
//! between platforms whose maths libraries round `ln`, `cos` or `powf` differently,
//! which moves points near the margin.
//!
//! `cargo test --release -p vardefm-modem level_gate -- --ignored --nocapture`
//!
//! `level_sweep` measures the points again; with `WRITE=1` it records them, and the
//! commit and command, in `perf/levels.toml`. Commit the code first, so the recorded
//! commit is the one measured.
//!
//! `WRITE=1 cargo test --release -p vardefm-modem level_sweep -- --ignored --nocapture`
//!
//! Environment: `MODES` (narrow,wide), `LEVELS` (0,1,..,6; `h` is the header),
//! `TRIALS` (bursts per point: 100 for the gate, 200 for the sweep's fine grid),
//! `WRITE` (sweep only).
