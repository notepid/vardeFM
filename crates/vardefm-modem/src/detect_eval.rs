//! Side-by-side evaluation of burst detectors through the FM channel simulator.
//!
//! Every detector sees exactly the same received audio, so differences are paired
//! and can be tested with McNemar's exact test instead of comparing two noisy rates.
//! For each CNR it reports, per detector:
//! - `burst`, the measure that counts: the whole burst (header and every codeword)
//!   decoded by an offline equivalent of `Receiver::step`. It tries the header at each
//!   detection in turn, searches on after one that fails, and keeps the first header
//!   that decodes. A test checks it against the streaming `Receiver`;
//! - `hit`: the detector's first detection, whatever its header does, lies within
//!   ±ncp/4 samples of the true position, which is where Schmidl-Cox's preamble-B fine
//!   timing lands on a noiseless copy. A detector that always picks another point
//!   inside the cyclic prefix can decode every burst and still score few hits, so read
//!   `hit` as a diagnostic only.
//!
//! `genie` decodes from the true position: a known-timing reference, not a strict
//! bound. Another valid position inside the cyclic prefix puts the FFT windows on
//! other noise samples and can decode a recording that fails at the true position,
//! so a detector may occasionally beat it. The gap between `genie` and a detector
//! approximates what detection costs at that CNR.
//!
//! A separate pass counts detections and decoded headers per minute on audio that
//! holds no burst (a carrier at -10 dB CNR, which sounds like an open squelch, a
//! weak unmodulated carrier, white noise, and keyed tones: 750 + 1500 Hz, a roger
//! beep and DTMF pairs, each 0.3 s on and 0.3 s off).
//! A detection there costs a header decode; a decoded header there is a false burst.
//! The streaming receiver's CPU load on that audio, fed in 10 ms chunks like a sound
//! card, is reported per detector too.
//!
//! `cargo test --release -p vardefm-modem detector_eval -- --ignored --nocapture`
//!
//! Environment: `MODES` (narrow,wide), `TRIALS` per CNR (100), `LEVEL` (1), `NCW` (1),
//! `CNRS` (dB list, default per mode), `NOISE_SECONDS` per noise case (60),
//! `CSV` (file to append the burst results to). Two more change the bursts' path, not
//! the noise cases: `CHANNEL`, the radio audio response (matched, tx-pre-only or
//! rx-de-only, see [`CHANNELS`]), and `TX_TILT`, dB/octave the sender tilts its audio
//! by beyond what the receiver expects (0).
