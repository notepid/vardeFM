## 1. Physical layer

### 1.1 Common
- Real-valued audio, 48 000 samples/s.
- OFDM with a cyclic prefix. Carrier *k* (0-based) sits at FFT bin `first_bin + k`.
  The time signal is the real part of a Hermitian-symmetric IFFT, scaled by 1/√N.
- The TX applies a spectral tilt: carrier gain = `10^(tilt · log2(f_k / f_0) / 20)`.
- Output is scaled to the mode's RMS level and clipped at ±1.0 (full scale = peak deviation).

| Parameter | narrow | wide |
|---|---|---|
| FFT size N | 1024 | 512 |
| Cyclic prefix | 128 (2.67 ms) | 64 (1.33 ms) |
| Carrier spacing | 46.875 Hz | 93.75 Hz |
| first_bin / carriers | 9 / 49 | 3 / 62 |
| Band | 421.9–2671.9 Hz | 281.3–6000 Hz |
| Pilot spacing | 6 | 6 |
| Pilots / data carriers | 9 / 40 | 12 / 50 |
| Symbol rate | 41.67 /s | 83.33 /s |
| TX tilt | 0 dB/oct | +3 dB/oct |
| TX RMS | 0.25 | 0.30 |

### 1.2 Pseudo-random sequences
All known sequences come from xorshift32 (`x ^= x<<13; x ^= x>>17; x ^= x<<5`). Each
output bit is the most significant bit of the new state; bit 0 maps to +1, bit 1 to −1.

| Use | Seed |
|---|---|
| Pilot table (32 symbols × pilots, row by row) | 0x5EED0001 |
| Preamble A | 0x5EED00A1 |
| Preamble B | 0x5EED00B2 |
| Leader (I then Q per carrier) | 0x5EED00C3 |

### 1.3 Frame
```
[leader × n][preamble A][preamble B][data 0] … [data nsym-1]
```
- **Leader:** `ceil(txdelay / symbol duration)` symbols of pseudo-random QPSK on every
  carrier. It covers the radio's key-up time and is not used by the receiver.
- **Preamble A:** BPSK × √2 on carriers whose FFT bin is even, zero elsewhere. One value
  is drawn per carrier, odd-bin carriers included, so the sequence stays aligned. The time
  signal repeats every N/2 samples, for Schmidl-Cox detection.
- **Preamble B:** BPSK on every carrier. Used for exact timing and the channel estimate.
- **Data symbols:** pilots on carriers where `k mod pilot_spacing == 0` and on the last
  carrier. The pilot value is `table[sym mod 32][pilot index]`. Data fills the remaining
  carriers in ascending order.

### 1.4 Constellations
Gray-coded, unit average power. BPSK uses the I axis only. For square QAM, the first half
of each symbol's bits selects the I level and the second half the Q level, MSB first. The
Gray word *g* maps to level index *i* = gray⁻¹(*g*), amplitude `(2i − (L−1)) · scale`.
So BPSK maps bit 0 to −1 and bit 1 to +1.

### 1.5 Receiver (informative)
The reference receiver:
1. Low-pass filters the audio (wide mode only) and runs a Schmidl-Cox autocorrelation.
2. Confirms the frame by cross-correlating with preamble B.
3. Places the FFT window mid cyclic prefix, which absorbs clock drift of ±ncp/2 samples
   over the frame.
4. Estimates the channel from preamble B, smoothed across frequency.
5. Tracks it with pilots averaged over ±4 symbols and interpolated in magnitude and phase.

Because the window never moves, a frame should stay shorter than
`ncp / 2 / (clock error)`. At 100 ppm that is 13 s (narrow) or 6.7 s (wide).

## 2. Bursts and error correction

### 2.1 Burst layout
One transmission is one burst, sent as one OFDM frame (section 1.3):
```
[leader][preamble A][preamble B][header: 400 coded bits, BPSK][payload: ncw × 2400 coded bits]
```
The header fills 10 symbols in narrow mode (40 data carriers) and 8 in wide mode (50).
The payload uses the header's speed level for every codeword. A burst carries at most
24 codewords and at most 4.0 s of payload, so clock drift stays inside the cyclic prefix
(section 1.5).

### 2.2 Speed levels
Every payload codeword is 2400 bits. *k* is the LDPC information length; each codeword
carries `k/8 − 4` data bytes followed by a big-endian CRC-32.

| Level | Modulation | Code rate | k | Bytes/codeword | Net rate narrow | Net rate wide |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | BPSK | 1/2 | 1200 | 146 | 0.7 kbit/s | 1.9 kbit/s |
| 1 | QPSK | 1/2 | 1200 | 146 | 1.5 kbit/s | 3.8 kbit/s |
| 2 | QPSK | 3/4 | 1800 | 221 | 2.2 kbit/s | 5.8 kbit/s |
| 3 | 16QAM | 1/2 | 1200 | 146 | 2.9 kbit/s | 7.6 kbit/s |
| 4 | 16QAM | 3/4 | 1800 | 221 | 4.5 kbit/s | 11.5 kbit/s |
| 5 | 64QAM | 2/3 | 1600 | 196 | 5.9 kbit/s | 14.9 kbit/s |
| 6 | 64QAM | 5/6 | 2000 | 246 | 7.4 kbit/s | 18.7 kbit/s |

Net rate = data bytes of a full burst ÷ its airtime (leader, preambles and header
included), before link-layer overhead. In the FM channel simulator, level 6 decodes
error-free from about 20 dB carrier-to-noise in narrow mode and 28 dB in wide mode.
Level 1 decodes from 8 dB (narrow) and 12 dB (wide).

### 2.3 Header (96 bits before coding)
80 bits of fields, MSB first, then a CRC-16/CCITT-FALSE (poly 0x1021, init 0xFFFF) over
the 10 field bytes.

| Bits | Field |
|---|---|
| 3 | kind: 0 ConnectReq, 1 ConnectAck, 2 Data, 3 Disc, 4 DiscAck |
| 8 | session id (random, chosen by the caller) |
| 3 | payload speed level |
| 5 | ncw: payload codewords (0–24) |
| 3 | req_level: level the sender asks the peer to use next |
| 3 | burst_id: sender's burst counter, mod 8 |
| 3 | ack_burst: burst_id of the peer burst being acknowledged |
| 24 | ack_offset: next byte offset expected from the peer, mod 2²⁴ |
| 24 | bitmap: bit *i* (LSB = codeword 0) set if codeword *i* of burst `ack_burst` decoded |
| 4 | flags: bit 0 = POLL (the peer must answer) |

### 2.4 LDPC codes
Systematic IRA codes: `H = [Hu | Hp]`, where `Hp` is a staircase (check *i* holds parity
bits *i* and *i−1*). Encoding is a running XOR: `p_i = p_{i−1} ⊕ (Hu row i · u)`. The
codeword is the information bits followed by the parity bits. `Hu` comes from
`Ldpc::new(n, k, seed)` (crates/vardefm-fec/src/ldpc.rs):
1. `m = n − k`; `dv = max(3, ceil(3m/k))`, capped at `m`.
2. Socket list `s[e] = e mod m` for `e < k·dv`, shuffled by Fisher-Yates driven by
   xorshift32(seed): `j = next() mod (i+1)` for `i` from `k·dv−1` down to 1.
3. Information bit *j* joins checks `s[j·dv … j·dv+dv−1]`. Repeated checks within one
   column are removed by random swaps with the same generator (see code).

| Code | n | k | Seed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Header | 400 | 96 | 0x1D9C1000 |
| Payload | 2400 | 1200 / 1600 / 1800 / 2000 | 0x1D9C0000 + k |

The reference decoder is layered normalized min-sum (α = 0.75, 50 iterations).

### 2.5 Scrambling and interleaving
- Information bits are XORed with xorshift32 bits before encoding. The seed is
  0x5C4AFFFF for the header and 0x5C4A0000 + codeword index for the payload.
- Coded bits are permuted by Fisher-Yates over the whole header (seed 0x17E40002) or the
  whole payload of the burst (all codewords together, seed 0x17E40001). Coded bit *j*
  goes to slot `perm[j]`. Slots fill OFDM symbols in order, carrier by carrier, with
  each carrier's constellation bits together.

## 3. Link layer

### 3.1 Sessions
- **Connect:** the caller sends `ConnectReq` (level 0, one codeword) with payload
  `"VFM1" | len | source call | len | destination call`, zero padded, and a random
  non-zero session id. A station that has `LISTEN ON` and the destination among its
  `MYCALL`s answers `ConnectAck` with the same payload and session id. The caller retries
  5 times, then gives up and reports DISCONNECTED (about 17 s in narrow mode, 11 s in
  wide).
- **Turns:** the called station may send first right after `ConnectAck`; the caller
  waits one response period for it.
- Bursts with a different session id are ignored.

### 3.2 Data transfer
- Each direction is a byte stream numbered by offset. A payload codeword carries one
  segment: `offset mod 2²⁴ (3 bytes) | length (1 byte) | data | zero padding`.
- **Acknowledgements:** every burst carries `ack_offset` and the bitmap for the peer's
  last burst. The sender drops acknowledged bytes and resends the rest, re-split to fit
  the current level. Data is delivered to the host in order, exactly once.
- **Turn-taking:** a station that receives a burst with data, or with POLL, answers after
  0.2 s. The answer holds acks plus any data of its own. If neither side has data, the
  link goes quiet. Either station may then start a burst once the channel has been clear
  for a short random time.
- **Rate adaptation:** `req_level` is the highest level whose SNR threshold plus 1 dB is
  at or below the measured SNR. Thresholds: 3.5, 5, 7, 9.5, 12.5, 16.5, 20 dB. After a
  failed codeword the request drops at least one level below the burst's level. Each
  unanswered burst lowers our own level by one. The called station starts at the level
  it measured on the connect request.
- **Retries:** an unanswered burst is resent after 1.2 s (plus a random back-off, and
  longer while the channel is busy). After 8 consecutive failures the link is lost.
- **Keepalive:** a quiet link is probed with a POLL burst after 30 s (caller) or 45 s
  (called station).

### 3.3 Disconnect
- **Graceful:** once all of its data is acknowledged, the closing station sends `Disc`;
  the peer answers `DiscAck`. Both report DISCONNECTED. `Disc` is retried up to 4 times;
  a station that already closed still answers a repeated `Disc`.
- **ABORT:** the station sends one `Disc` without waiting and closes at once.

No encryption is used, and there is no compression yet.

## 4. Host interface

VardeFM offers VARA's TCP interface. The command port (default 8300) carries ASCII lines
ending in CR; LF is also accepted as a terminator. The data port (command port + 1)
carries raw bytes. Each port takes one client; a new connection replaces the old one.
Verified against EA5HVK's "VARA Protocol Native TNC Commands" (February 2022) and Pat's
VARA driver (github.com/n8jja/Pat-Vara).

### 4.1 Host → modem
Each command gets `OK`, or `WRONG` if it is invalid.

| Command | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `MYCALL c1 [c2 … c5]` | Up to 5 call signs: 3–7 characters A–Z/0–9, optional SSID −1…−15, −T or −R. |
| `LISTEN ON` / `LISTEN OFF` | Accept incoming connections or not. |
| `CONNECT <mycall> <target>` | `WRONG` if a session is already active. |
| `DISCONNECT` | Graceful: closes once everything queued is acknowledged. |
| `ABORT` | Immediate close. |
| `VERSION` | `OK`, then `VERSION VardeFM <version>`. |
| `PUBLIC ON/OFF`, `COMPRESSION OFF/TEXT/FILES`, `CHAT ON/OFF`, `CWID ON/OFF`, `BW500/BW2300/BW2750`, `WINLINK SESSION`, `P2P SESSION` | Accepted (`OK`), no effect. |

### 4.2 Modem → host
| Line | When |
|---|---|
| `CONNECTED <source> <destination> NARROW` (or `WIDE`) | Session up. `source` is the calling station. |
| `DISCONNECTED` | Session closed for any reason: DISCONNECT, ABORT, peer closed, link lost, or connect failed. |
| `PENDING` | Called side: a connect request for us arrived (followed by `CONNECTED`). |
| `CANCELPENDING` | Reserved; not sent yet. |
| `BUFFER <n>` | Bytes queued and not yet acknowledged. Sent after every read from the data port (even if *n* is unchanged), and whenever acknowledgements change *n*, down to `BUFFER 0`. A report that follows a write therefore already counts that write. |
| `PTT ON` / `PTT OFF` | Transmitter keyed / released. |
| `BUSY ON` / `BUSY OFF` | Channel activity heard (audio above the squelch threshold, or a frame being received). |
| `IAMALIVE` | Every 60 s. |

### 4.3 Data port
While connected, bytes written are sent and received bytes are delivered. Any byte value
is allowed. Bytes written while not connected are dropped. Data written after
`DISCONNECT` is still sent, as in VARA, until the closing `Disc` goes out.

**Ordering across the two sockets.** Every byte written to the data port before
`DISCONNECT` was sent on the command port is transmitted, whether or not a `BUFFER`
report counted it yet. The modem holds `DISCONNECT` back until its data-port reader has
found the socket empty (at most 0.5 s). `DISCONNECT` and `ABORT` arriving after the link
has already ended get `OK` and have no effect. In particular, no second `DISCONNECTED`
is sent.

**Advice for hosts (also for real VARA, which has the same two-socket design):** before
`DISCONNECT`, wait for a `BUFFER 0` that arrives *after* your last data write. A
`BUFFER 0` read just after a write may be stale. After `DISCONNECTED`, keep reading the
data port briefly (about 0.5 s), because received data and the `DISCONNECTED` line
travel on different sockets.

### 4.4 Differences from VARA
- `CONNECT … via <digis>` (VARA FM digipeating) is not supported (`WRONG`).
- `CONNECTED` always ends with `NARROW` or `WIDE`, like VARA FM's bandwidth field
  (the VARA document's example is `CONNECTED EA5HVK-7 EB1MS-3 WIDE`).
- `LISTEN ON/OFF` does not drop an active session (VARA's document says it does).
- After `ABORT`, `DISCONNECTED` is always sent (Pat notes that VARA sometimes omits it).
- `DISCONNECT` or `ABORT` with no session gives `OK` and nothing else.
- `VERSION` gets `OK` before the `VERSION …` line. Whether real VARA sends `OK` here is
  unverified, so hosts should accept either.
- If the command-port client disconnects, any session is aborted.
- Not implemented: `CQFRAME`, `SN` reports, `REGISTERED`/`LINK REGISTERED`, encryption,
  compression.
