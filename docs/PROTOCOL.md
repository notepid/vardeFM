## 1. Physical layer

### 1.1 Common
- Real-valued audio, 48 000 samples/s.
- OFDM with a cyclic prefix. Carrier *k* (0-based) sits at FFT bin `first_bin + k`.
  The time signal is the real part of a Hermitian-symmetric IFFT, scaled by 1/√N.
- The TX applies a spectral tilt: carrier gain = `10^(tilt · log2(f_k / f_0) / 20)`.
- Each burst is scaled to the TX RMS of its speed level (table below; header-only bursts
  use level 0's), measured over the whole burst including the leader. Robust levels go
  out louder: they gain more from the extra deviation than they lose to clipping.
- Peaks are then limited to ±1.0 (full scale = peak deviation) by clip and filter:
  1. A 4th-order Butterworth low-pass at 1.15 × the top carrier frequency removes the
     sidelobes of the symbol edges.
  2. Twice: what clipping at ±1.0 would remove is low-passed forwards and backwards
     (zero phase) with the same filter and subtracted.
  3. A final clamp at ±1.0.

  Power above 1.3 × the top carrier stays more than 30 dB below the in-band power even
  at RMS 0.55 (plain clipping: about 21 dB).

| Parameter | narrow | wide |
|---|---|---|
| FFT size N | 1024 | 512 |
| Cyclic prefix | 128 (2.67 ms) | 64 (1.33 ms) |
| Carrier spacing | 46.875 Hz | 93.75 Hz |
| first_bin / carriers | 9 / 49 | 3 / 62 |
| Band | 421.9–2671.9 Hz | 281.3–6000 Hz |
| Pilot spacing | 6 | 6 |
| Pilots / data carriers | 9 / 40 | 12 / 50 |
| Symbol rate | 41.67 /s | 83.33 /s |
| TX tilt | 0 dB/oct | +3 dB/oct |
| TX RMS, levels 0–2 / 3–4 / 5–6 | 0.30 / 0.30 / 0.25 | 0.50 / 0.40 / 0.30 |
| TX low-pass | 3073 Hz | 6900 Hz |

### 1.2 Pseudo-random sequences
All known sequences come from xorshift32 (`x ^= x<<13; x ^= x>>17; x ^= x<<5`). Each
output bit is the most significant bit of the new state; bit 0 maps to +1, bit 1 to −1.

| Use | Seed |
|---|---|
| Pilot table (32 symbols × pilots, row by row) | 0x5EED0001 |
| Preamble A | 0x5EED00A1 |
| Preamble B | 0x5EED00B2 |
| Leader (I then Q per carrier) | 0x5EED00C3 |

### 1.3 Frame
```
[leader × n][preamble A][preamble B][data 0] … [data nsym-1]
```
- **Leader:** `ceil(txdelay / symbol duration)` symbols of pseudo-random QPSK on every
  carrier. It covers the radio's key-up time and is not used by the receiver.
- **Preamble A:** BPSK × √2 on carriers whose FFT bin is even, zero elsewhere. One value
  is drawn per carrier, odd-bin carriers included, so the sequence stays aligned. The time
  signal repeats every N/2 samples, for Schmidl-Cox detection.
- **Preamble B:** BPSK on every carrier. Used for exact timing and the channel estimate.
- **Data symbols:** pilots on carriers where `k mod pilot_spacing == 0` and on the last
  carrier. The pilot value is `table[sym mod 32][pilot index]`. Data fills the remaining
  carriers in ascending order.

### 1.4 Constellations
Gray-coded, unit average power. BPSK uses the I axis only. For square QAM, the first half
of each symbol's bits selects the I level and the second half the Q level, MSB first. The
Gray word *g* maps to level index *i* = gray⁻¹(*g*), amplitude `(2i − (L−1)) · scale`.
So BPSK maps bit 0 to −1 and bit 1 to +1.

### 1.5 Receiver (informative)
The reference receiver:
1. Low-pass filters the audio (wide mode only) and runs a Schmidl-Cox autocorrelation.
2. Confirms the frame by cross-correlating with preamble B.
3. Places the FFT window mid cyclic prefix, which absorbs clock drift of ±ncp/2 samples
   over the frame.
4. Estimates the channel from preamble B, smoothed across frequency, and decodes the
   header with it. Once the header has decoded, it demodulates the frame again with the
   header symbols (now known) averaged into the channel estimate, each weighted by the
   inverse of its noise: the header decodes through a click on one of its symbols, and
   that symbol must not corrupt the estimate.
5. Tracks it with pilots averaged over ±4 symbols and interpolated in magnitude and phase.
6. Estimates the noise per carrier and, from the pilots, a noise scale per symbol, so
   that a symbol hit by an FM click or a squelch pop gets low-confidence LLRs.

Because the window never moves, a frame should stay shorter than
`ncp / 2 / (clock error)`. At 100 ppm that is 13 s (narrow) or 6.7 s (wide).

## 2. Bursts and error correction

### 2.1 Burst layout
One transmission is one burst, sent as one OFDM frame (section 1.3):
```
[leader][preamble A][preamble B][header: 400 coded bits, BPSK][payload: ncw × 2400 coded bits]
```
The header fills 10 symbols in narrow mode (40 data carriers) and 8 in wide mode (50).
The payload uses the header's speed level for every codeword. A burst carries at most
24 codewords and at most 4.0 s of payload, so clock drift stays inside the cyclic prefix
(section 1.5).

### 2.2 Speed levels
Every payload codeword is 2400 bits. *k* is the LDPC information length; each codeword
carries `k/8 − 4` data bytes followed by a big-endian CRC-32.

| Level | Modulation | Code rate | k | Bytes/codeword | Net rate narrow | Net rate wide |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | BPSK | 1/2 | 1200 | 146 | 0.7 kbit/s | 1.9 kbit/s |
| 1 | QPSK | 1/2 | 1200 | 146 | 1.5 kbit/s | 3.8 kbit/s |
| 2 | QPSK | 3/4 | 1800 | 221 | 2.2 kbit/s | 5.8 kbit/s |
| 3 | 16QAM | 1/2 | 1200 | 146 | 2.9 kbit/s | 7.6 kbit/s |
| 4 | 16QAM | 3/4 | 1800 | 221 | 4.5 kbit/s | 11.5 kbit/s |
| 5 | 64QAM | 2/3 | 1600 | 196 | 5.9 kbit/s | 14.9 kbit/s |
| 6 | 64QAM | 5/6 | 2000 | 246 | 7.4 kbit/s | 18.7 kbit/s |

Net rate = data bytes of a full burst ÷ its airtime (leader, preambles and header
included), before link-layer overhead. In the FM channel simulator, level 6 decodes
error-free from about 16.5 dB carrier-to-noise in narrow mode and 24.5 dB in wide mode.
Level 1 decodes every burst it detects from 4.5 dB (narrow) and 6.5 dB (wide); below
about 8 dB (narrow) and 11 dB (wide) some bursts are not detected at all.

### 2.3 Header (96 bits before coding)
80 bits of fields, MSB first, then a CRC-16/CCITT-FALSE (poly 0x1021, init 0xFFFF) over
the 10 field bytes.

| Bits | Field |
|---|---|
| 3 | kind: 0 ConnectReq, 1 ConnectAck, 2 Data, 3 Disc, 4 DiscAck |
| 8 | session id (random, chosen by the caller) |
| 3 | payload speed level |
| 5 | ncw: payload codewords (0–24) |
| 3 | req_level: level the sender asks the peer to use next |
| 3 | burst_id: sender's burst counter, mod 8 |
| 3 | ack_burst: burst_id of the peer burst being acknowledged |
| 24 | ack_offset: next byte offset expected from the peer, mod 2²⁴ |
| 24 | bitmap: bit *i* (LSB = codeword 0) set if codeword *i* of burst `ack_burst` decoded |
| 4 | flags: bit 0 = POLL (the peer must answer) |

### 2.4 LDPC codes
Systematic IRA codes: `H = [Hu | Hp]`, where `Hp` is a staircase (check *i* holds parity
bits *i* and *i−1*). Encoding is a running XOR: `p_i = p_{i−1} ⊕ (Hu row i · u)`. The
codeword is the information bits followed by the parity bits. `Hu` is built by
progressive edge growth (PEG) from `(n, k, seed)` (`Ldpc::new` in
crates/vardefm-fec/src/ldpc.rs). The construction is normative: both ends must build
identical graphs.
1. **Degrees.** `m = n − k`. Of the *k* information bits, the last
   `h = min(⌊(4k + 5m)/20⌋, ⌊k/2⌋)` have degree 8 and the first `k − h` have degree
   `max(3, ⌈3m/2k⌉)`. Both degrees are capped at *m*.
2. **Starting graph.** The Tanner graph starts with the staircase edges only: parity
   bit *p* is in checks *p* and *p+1*, and the last parity bit (*m−1*) only in check
   *m−1*. A check's degree counts all its edges, parity edges included, so check 0
   starts at degree 1 and every other check at degree 2.
3. **Edge growth.** Let `rng` be xorshift32 (section 1.2) seeded with `seed`. For
   *j* = 0, 1, …, *k−1* in turn, add the *d_j* edges of information bit *j* one at a time.
   For each edge:
   - Compute the distance (number of edges) from bit *j* to every check in the
     current graph. The current graph holds the staircase, every edge added so far
     and the earlier edges of bit *j* itself.
   - If some checks cannot be reached from bit *j*, the candidates are those checks.
     This always applies to a bit's first edge, when all *m* checks are candidates.
     Otherwise the candidates are the checks at the greatest distance.
   - Keep the candidates with the lowest current degree, in ascending check order.
     Connect bit *j* to the one at index `rng.next() mod (number kept)`. Draw exactly
     one `next()` per edge, also when only one candidate is kept, and add 1 to the
     chosen check's degree.

| Code | n | k | Degree-8 bits | Other bits | Seed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Header | 400 | 96 | 48 | 48 × degree 5 | 0x1D9C1000 |
| Payload | 2400 | 1200 | 540 | 660 × degree 3 | 0x1D9C04B0 |
| Payload | 2400 | 1600 | 520 | 1080 × degree 3 | 0x1D9C0640 |
| Payload | 2400 | 1800 | 510 | 1290 × degree 3 | 0x1D9C0708 |
| Payload | 2400 | 2000 | 500 | 1500 × degree 3 | 0x1D9C07D0 |

Payload seeds are 0x1D9C0000 + *k*. A hash of each of these graphs is pinned by the
`construction_is_stable` test in ldpc.rs.

Informative: none of the graphs has a 4-cycle. The header and rate-1/2 graphs have
girth 8; the denser high-rate graphs have girth 6. Check degrees differ by at most 2
within a code. The reference decoder is layered offset min-sum: every
check-to-variable magnitude is `max(0, min − 0.5)`, with no scaling, for at most 50
iterations, and input LLRs are clamped to ±40. On BPSK/AWGN with it, frame error rate
1% is reached at Eb/N0 ≈ 1.5 dB (rate 1/2), 2.1 dB (2/3), 2.6 dB (3/4), 3.3 dB (5/6)
and 2.2 dB (header).

### 2.5 Scrambling and interleaving
- Information bits are XORed with xorshift32 bits before encoding. The seed is
  0x5C4AFFFF for the header and 0x5C4A0000 + codeword index for the payload.
- Coded bits are permuted by Fisher-Yates over the whole header (seed 0x17E40002) or the
  whole payload of the burst (all codewords together, seed 0x17E40001). Coded bit *j*
  goes to slot `perm[j]`. Slots fill OFDM symbols in order, carrier by carrier, with
  each carrier's constellation bits together.

## 3. Link layer

### 3.1 Sessions
- **Connect:** the caller sends `ConnectReq` (level 0, one codeword) with payload
  `"VFM1" | len | source call | len | destination call`, zero padded, and a random
  non-zero session id. A station that has `LISTEN ON` and the destination among its
  `MYCALL`s answers `ConnectAck` with the same payload and session id. The caller retries
  5 times, then gives up and reports DISCONNECTED (about 17 s in narrow mode, 11 s in
  wide).
- **Turns:** the called station may send first right after `ConnectAck`; the caller
  waits one response period for it.
- Bursts with a different session id are ignored.

### 3.2 Data transfer
- Each direction is a byte stream numbered by offset. A payload codeword carries one
  segment: `offset mod 2²⁴ (3 bytes) | length (1 byte) | data | zero padding`.
- **Acknowledgements:** every burst carries `ack_offset` and the bitmap for the peer's
  last burst. The sender drops acknowledged bytes and resends the rest, re-split to fit
  the current level. Data is delivered to the host in order, exactly once.
- **Turn-taking:** a station that receives a burst with data, or with POLL, answers after
  0.2 s. The answer holds acks plus any data of its own. If neither side has data, the
  link goes quiet. Either station may then start a burst once the channel has been clear
  for a short random time.
- **Rate adaptation:** `req_level` is the highest level whose SNR threshold plus 1 dB is
  at or below the predicted SNR at that level. The SNR is measured on a burst sent at the
  burst's own level. Another level's SNR is predicted from the drive difference and each
  level's SNR ceiling (the clipping floor of its drive, measured in the simulator):
  `1/snr = 1/(channel · drive²) + 1/ceiling`. Thresholds (estimated SNR on a burst at that
  level, levels 0–6): −2, 1.5, 4.5, 7, 11, 15, 18 dB (level 0's is never used). After a
  failed codeword the request drops at least one level below the burst's level. Each
  unanswered burst lowers our own level by one. The called station starts at the level
  it measured on the connect request.
- **Retries:** an unanswered burst is resent after 1.2 s (plus a random back-off, and
  longer while the channel is busy). After 8 consecutive failures the link is lost.
- **Keepalive:** a quiet link is probed with a POLL burst after 30 s (caller) or 45 s
  (called station).

### 3.3 Disconnect
- **Graceful:** once all of its data is acknowledged, the closing station sends `Disc`;
  the peer answers `DiscAck`. Both report DISCONNECTED. `Disc` is retried up to 4 times;
  a station that already closed still answers a repeated `Disc`.
- **ABORT:** the station sends one `Disc` without waiting and closes at once.

No encryption is used, and there is no compression yet.

## 4. Host interface

VardeFM offers VARA's TCP interface. The command port (default 8300) carries ASCII lines
ending in CR; LF is also accepted as a terminator. The data port (command port + 1)
carries raw bytes. Each port takes one client; a new connection replaces the old one.
Verified against EA5HVK's "VARA Protocol Native TNC Commands" (February 2022) and Pat's
VARA driver (github.com/n8jja/Pat-Vara).

### 4.1 Host → modem
Each command gets `OK`, or `WRONG` if it is invalid.

| Command | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `MYCALL c1 [c2 … c5]` | Up to 5 call signs: 3–7 characters A–Z/0–9, optional SSID −1…−15, −T or −R. |
| `LISTEN ON` / `LISTEN OFF` | Accept incoming connections or not. |
| `CONNECT <mycall> <target>` | `WRONG` if a session is already active. |
| `DISCONNECT` | Graceful: closes once everything queued is acknowledged. |
| `ABORT` | Immediate close. |
| `VERSION` | `OK`, then `VERSION VardeFM <version>`. |
| `PUBLIC ON/OFF`, `COMPRESSION OFF/TEXT/FILES`, `CHAT ON/OFF`, `CWID ON/OFF`, `BW500/BW2300/BW2750`, `WINLINK SESSION`, `P2P SESSION` | Accepted (`OK`), no effect. |

### 4.2 Modem → host
| Line | When |
|---|---|
| `CONNECTED <source> <destination> NARROW` (or `WIDE`) | Session up. `source` is the calling station. |
| `DISCONNECTED` | Session closed for any reason: DISCONNECT, ABORT, peer closed, link lost, or connect failed. |
| `PENDING` | Called side: a connect request for us arrived (followed by `CONNECTED`). |
| `CANCELPENDING` | Reserved; not sent yet. |
| `BUFFER <n>` | Bytes queued and not yet acknowledged. Sent after every read from the data port (even if *n* is unchanged), and whenever acknowledgements change *n*, down to `BUFFER 0`. A report that follows a write therefore already counts that write. |
| `PTT ON` / `PTT OFF` | Transmitter keyed / released. |
| `BUSY ON` / `BUSY OFF` | Channel activity heard (audio in the carrier band at least 6 dB above the background level and above −40 dBFS, or a frame being received). The band is 422–2672 Hz in narrow mode and 400–6000 Hz in wide mode (filter edges, 6–9 dB down); sound outside it, such as a CTCSS tone, mains hum or hiss above the band, does not count. A steady open-squelch hiss becomes the background within about 2 s. |
| `IAMALIVE` | Every 60 s. |

### 4.3 Data port
While connected, bytes written are sent and received bytes are delivered. Any byte value
is allowed. Bytes written while not connected are dropped. Data written after
`DISCONNECT` is still sent, as in VARA, until the closing `Disc` goes out.

**Ordering across the two sockets.** Every byte written to the data port before
`DISCONNECT` was sent on the command port is transmitted, whether or not a `BUFFER`
report counted it yet. The modem holds `DISCONNECT` back until its data-port reader has
found the socket empty (at most 0.5 s). `DISCONNECT` and `ABORT` arriving after the link
has already ended get `OK` and have no effect. In particular, no second `DISCONNECTED`
is sent.

**Advice for hosts (also for real VARA, which has the same two-socket design):** before
`DISCONNECT`, wait for a `BUFFER 0` that arrives *after* your last data write. A
`BUFFER 0` read just after a write may be stale. After `DISCONNECTED`, keep reading the
data port briefly (about 0.5 s), because received data and the `DISCONNECTED` line
travel on different sockets.

### 4.4 Differences from VARA
- `CONNECT … via <digis>` (VARA FM digipeating) is not supported (`WRONG`).
- `CONNECTED` always ends with `NARROW` or `WIDE`, like VARA FM's bandwidth field
  (the VARA document's example is `CONNECTED EA5HVK-7 EB1MS-3 WIDE`).
- `LISTEN ON/OFF` does not drop an active session (VARA's document says it does).
- After `ABORT`, `DISCONNECTED` is always sent (Pat notes that VARA sometimes omits it).
- `DISCONNECT` or `ABORT` with no session gives `OK` and nothing else.
- `VERSION` gets `OK` before the `VERSION …` line. Whether real VARA sends `OK` here is
  unverified, so hosts should accept either.
- If the command-port client disconnects, any session is aborted.
- Not implemented: `CQFRAME`, `SN` reports, `REGISTERED`/`LINK REGISTERED`, encryption,
  compression.
